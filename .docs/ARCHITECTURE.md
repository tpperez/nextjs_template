## Overview

This document outlines the architectural decisions, design patterns, and system organization that form the foundation of this Next.js template. The architecture prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity through clear separation of concerns and established conventions.

## System Architecture

### Layered Architecture Model

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of responsibilities:

```
Routes (Server Components)
    ↓
Queries (Data Fetching)
    ↓
Views (Page Structure)
    ↓
Components (UI Elements)
    ↓
Services & Stores (Business Logic)
    ↓
Utils & Hooks (Shared Logic)
```

### Layer Responsibilities

**Routes Layer**

- Server Components handling routing and initial data fetching
- Route-level error boundaries and loading states
- Direct integration with Next.js App Router

**Queries Layer**

- Data fetching abstraction co-located with routes
- API error handling and response formatting
- Cache configuration and revalidation strategies

**Views Layer**

- Complete page structures orchestrating multiple components
- Business logic coordination and state management
- User interaction handling and data presentation

**Components Layer**

- Reusable UI building blocks with focused responsibilities
- Design system implementation and consistency
- Accessibility and responsive design patterns

**Services & Stores Layer**

- Global business logic and API integrations
- Application state management and persistence
- Cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging

**Utils & Hooks Layer**

- Pure utility functions and data transformations
- Reusable custom hooks and shared logic
- Common patterns and helper functions

## Data Flow Patterns

### Route to View Data Flow

**Implementation Reference:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/page.tsx`

The standard data flow follows this pattern:

1. **Route Component** (Server Component) invokes query function
2. **Query Function** handles API calls and error management
3. **Route Component** passes structured data to View component
4. **View Component** renders using received data and manages UI state

**Benefits:**

- Views become pure components focused on presentation
- Queries provide reusable data fetching abstractions
- Server Components handle initial data loading efficiently
- Clear separation between data fetching and presentation logic

**Related Documentation:** [Development Guide - Data Fetching Patterns](DEVELOPMENT.md#data-fetching-patterns)

### Client-Side Data Management

**Implementation Reference:** `app/views/pokemon-detail/pokemon-detail.hook.ts`

Client-side data fetching is used strategically for:

- Real-time updates and user interactions
- Background data refreshing
- Conditional data loading based on user actions
- Optimistic updates and error recovery

## Module Organization

### Standard Module Structure

Every module in the application follows a consistent organization pattern:

```
module-name/
├── index.ts                 # Public exports and interface
├── module-name.tsx          # Main component implementation
├── module-name.type.ts      # TypeScript type definitions
├── module-name.const.ts     # Constants and configuration (optional)
├── module-name.hook.ts      # Custom hooks (optional)
├── module-name.util.ts      # Utility functions (optional)
└── components/              # Internal components (optional)
```

**Complete Example:** `app/views/pokemon-detail/`

**Related Documentation:** [Development Guide - Module Structure](DEVELOPMENT.md#standard-module-structure)

### File Placement Strategy

The decision between global and module-specific placement follows clear criteria:

| Resource Type | Global Location      | Module-Specific      | Decision Criteria                        |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Components    | `app/components/ui/` | `module/components/` | Used across 3+ different modules         |
| Custom Hooks  | `app/hooks/`         | `module.hook.ts`     | Reused in multiple contexts              |
| Utilities     | `app/utils/`         | `module.util.ts`     | Application-wide utility functions       |
| Constants     | `app/constants/`     | `module.const.ts`    | Configuration affecting multiple modules |
| Types         | `app/typings/`       | `module.type.ts`     | API contracts vs component props         |
| Services      | `app/services/`      | `module.service.ts`  | Business domain boundaries               |

**Decision Rule:** Start with module-specific placement and promote to global when usage expands beyond the original context.

## Data Fetching Architecture

### Server-Side First Strategy

The architecture prioritizes server-side data fetching for optimal performance and SEO:

**Primary Use Cases:**

- Initial page data and above-the-fold content
- SEO-critical information
- Static and semi-static content
- Authentication-dependent data

**Implementation Pattern:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/query/query.ts`

### Client-Side Strategic Implementation

Client-side fetching is employed selectively for enhanced user experience:

**Specific Use Cases:**

- Real-time data updates and notifications
- User interaction responses and form submissions
- Background data refreshing and cache updates
- Progressive data loading and infinite scroll

**Implementation Pattern:** `app/views/pokemon-detail/pokemon-detail.hook.ts`

### Query Organization Pattern

Data fetching logic is co-located with routes for clear dependency management:

```
app/(routes)/(public)/route-name/
├── page.tsx                 # Route component
└── query/                   # Data fetching module
    ├── index.ts            # Public exports
    ├── query.ts            # Fetch function implementations
    ├── query.const.ts      # GraphQL queries and constants
    └── query.type.ts       # Response type definitions
```

**Benefits:**

- Clear data dependencies for each route
- Route-specific cache configuration
- Simplified testing and mocking
- Reusable query functions across similar contexts

**Example Implementation:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/query/`

### Caching Strategy

The architecture implements multi-layer caching for optimal performance:

**Server-Side Caching (Next.js)**

- Static content: 24-hour revalidation
- Semi-dynamic content: 1-hour revalidation
- Dynamic content: 5-minute revalidation
- Personalized content: No caching

**Client-Side Caching (TanStack Query)**

- Background data updates for freshness
- Optimistic updates for perceived performance
- Stale-while-revalidate for error resilience
- Selective cache invalidation for data consistency

## HTTP Service Architecture

### Adapter Pattern Implementation

The HTTP service layer uses the adapter pattern for flexibility and maintainability:

**Core Components:**

- **Configuration Layer:** `app/services/http/core/core.ts`
- **Client Interfaces:** Unified REST and GraphQL APIs
- **Adapter Implementations:** Fetch, Axios, GraphQL-Request
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error formatting across adapters

**Architecture Benefits:**

- Interchangeable HTTP libraries without client code changes
- Consistent interface across different transport mechanisms
- Simplified testing through adapter mocking
- Future-proof design for emerging HTTP libraries

### Unified Client Interface

Both REST and GraphQL clients provide consistent APIs:

**Common Features:**

- Standardized error handling and response formatting
- Unified configuration options and defaults
- Consistent TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- Shared caching strategies and optimization

**REST Client Example:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/[name]/query/query.ts`
**GraphQL Client Example:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/query/query.ts`
**Configuration Reference:** `app/services/http/core/core.ts`

## State Management Architecture

### State Classification Strategy

The architecture distinguishes between different types of application state:

**Local Component State (React useState/useReducer)**

- Form data and input validation state
- UI component state (modals, dropdowns, toggles)
- Temporary interaction state
- Component-specific derived state

**Global Application State (Zustand)**

- User authentication and session data
- Application-wide preferences and settings
- Persistent user data and configurations
- Cross-component shared state

**Server State (TanStack Query)**

- API response data and caching
- Background synchronization
- Optimistic updates and error recovery
- Request state management (loading, error states)

**Decision Criteria:** Use global state when data needs to persist across route changes or is shared between unrelated components.

## Component Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

The component system is organized in layers of increasing specificity:

**UI Components** (`app/components/ui/`)

- Basic, reusable interface elements
- Design system implementation
- No business logic or external dependencies
- High reusability across different contexts

**Structure Components** (`app/components/structure/`)

- Layout and navigation components
- Application shell and wrapper components
- Shared structural patterns

**View Components** (`app/views/`)

- Complete page implementations
- Business logic coordination
- Component composition and orchestration
- Route-specific functionality

**View-Specific Components** (`app/views/[view]/components/`)

- Components used exclusively within specific views
- Complex view-internal logic and interactions
- Not intended for reuse outside the parent view

**Example Implementations:**

- UI Component: `app/components/ui/spinner/`
- View-Specific: `app/views/pokemon-detail/components/`

## Error Handling Architecture

### Layered Error Management

The architecture implements error handling at multiple levels:

**Server-Side Error Handling**

- Query functions handle API errors and network failures
- Structured error responses with consistent formatting
- Graceful degradation and fallback strategies
- Server-side error logging and monitoring

**Client-Side Error Handling**

- React Error Boundaries for component error isolation
- TanStack Query for data fetching error management
- User-friendly error messaging and recovery options
- Client-side error reporting and analytics

**Global Error Handling**

- Middleware for security and routing errors
- Consistent error response formats across the application
- Integration with logging and monitoring services
- Automatic error recovery and retry mechanisms

**Related Documentation:** [Development Guide - Error Handling Patterns](DEVELOPMENT.md#error-handling-patterns)

## Security Architecture

### Content Security Policy Implementation

**Configuration:** `middleware.ts`

The security layer implements comprehensive protection:

- Strict CSP headers for XSS prevention
- Nonce-based script execution control
- Restricted resource loading domains
- Frame protection and clickjacking prevention

### Type Safety Strategy

TypeScript configuration ensures compile-time safety:

- Strict mode enabled with no escape hatches
- Explicit `any` type prohibition through ESLint
- Comprehensive interface definitions for all data structures
- Generic type usage for reusable component patterns

## Performance Architecture

### Bundle Optimization Strategy

The architecture implements multiple optimization techniques:

- Dynamic imports for heavy components and libraries
- Route-level code splitting for optimal loading
- Tree shaking configuration for unused code elimination
- Image optimization through Next.js Image component

### Rendering Strategy

Balanced approach between server and client rendering:

- Server Components for initial page rendering
- Client Components only when interactivity is required
- Static Site Generation for cacheable content
- Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content

### Multi-Layer Caching

Comprehensive caching strategy across multiple layers:

1. **Browser Cache:** HTTP headers and service worker
2. **CDN Cache:** Edge location caching for global performance
3. **Next.js Cache:** Server-side rendering and API route caching
4. **Client Cache:** TanStack Query and application state caching

## Testing Architecture

### Testing Strategy Organization

The testing approach aligns with the component architecture:

**Unit Testing Focus**

- Component behavior and user interactions
- Utility function correctness and edge cases
- Business logic isolation and validation

**Integration Testing Scope**

- Component interaction patterns
- Data flow between architectural layers
- API integration and error handling

**Testing Structure Example:** `app/components/ui/spinner/`

### Co-location Principle

Tests are organized alongside implementation files for:
