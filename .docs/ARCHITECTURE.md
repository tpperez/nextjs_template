## Overview

This document outlines the architectural decisions, design patterns, and system organization that form the foundation of this Next.js template. The architecture prioritizes scalability, maintainability, and developer productivity through clear separation of concerns and established conventions.

## System Architecture

### Layered Architecture Model

The application follows a layered architecture pattern with clear separation of responsibilities:

```
Routes (Server Components)
    ↓
Queries (Data Fetching)
    ↓
Views (Page Structure)
    ↓
Components (UI Elements)
    ↓
Services & Stores (Business Logic)
    ↓
Utils & Hooks (Shared Logic)
```

### Layer Responsibilities

**Routes Layer**

- Server Components handling routing and initial data fetching
- Route-level error boundaries and loading states
- Direct integration with Next.js App Router

**Queries Layer**

- Data fetching abstraction co-located with routes
- API error handling and response formatting
- Cache configuration and revalidation strategies

**Views Layer**

- Complete page structures orchestrating multiple components
- Business logic coordination and state management
- User interaction handling and data presentation

**Components Layer**

- Reusable UI building blocks with focused responsibilities
- Design system implementation and consistency
- Accessibility and responsive design patterns

**Services & Stores Layer**

- Global business logic and API integrations
- Application state management and persistence
- Cross-cutting concerns like authentication and logging

**Utils & Hooks Layer**

- Pure utility functions and data transformations
- Reusable custom hooks and shared logic
- Common patterns and helper functions

## Data Flow Patterns

### Route to View Data Flow

**Implementation Reference:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/page.tsx`

The standard data flow follows this pattern:

1. **Route Component** (Server Component) invokes query function
2. **Query Function** handles API calls and error management
3. **Route Component** passes structured data to View component
4. **View Component** renders using received data and manages UI state

**Benefits:**

- Views become pure components focused on presentation
- Queries provide reusable data fetching abstractions
- Server Components handle initial data loading efficiently
- Clear separation between data fetching and presentation logic

**Related Documentation:** [Development Guide - Data Fetching Patterns](DEVELOPMENT.md#data-fetching-patterns)

### Client-Side Data Management

**Implementation Reference:** `app/views/pokemon-detail/pokemon-detail.hook.ts`

Client-side data fetching is used strategically for:

- Real-time updates and user interactions
- Background data refreshing
- Conditional data loading based on user actions
- Optimistic updates and error recovery

## Module Organization

### Standard Module Structure

Every module in the application follows a consistent organization pattern:

```
module-name/
├── index.ts                 # Public exports and interface
├── module-name.tsx          # Main component implementation
├── module-name.type.ts      # TypeScript type definitions
├── module-name.const.ts     # Constants and configuration (optional)
├── module-name.hook.ts      # Custom hooks (optional)
├── module-name.util.ts      # Utility functions (optional)
└── components/              # Internal components (optional)
```

**Complete Example:** `app/views/pokemon-detail/`

**Related Documentation:** [Development Guide - Module Structure](DEVELOPMENT.md#standard-module-structure)

### File Placement Strategy

The decision between global and module-specific placement follows clear criteria:

| Resource Type | Global Location      | Module-Specific      | Decision Criteria                        |
| ------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Components    | `app/components/ui/` | `module/components/` | Used across 3+ different modules         |
| Custom Hooks  | `app/hooks/`         | `module.hook.ts`     | Reused in multiple contexts              |
| Utilities     | `app/utils/`         | `module.util.ts`     | Application-wide utility functions       |
| Constants     | `app/constants/`     | `module.const.ts`    | Configuration affecting multiple modules |
| Types         | `app/typings/`       | `module.type.ts`     | API contracts vs component props         |
| Services      | `app/services/`      | `module.service.ts`  | Business domain boundaries               |

**Decision Rule:** Start with module-specific placement and promote to global when usage expands beyond the original context.

## HTTP Service Architecture

### Unified Client Pattern

The HTTP service layer implements an adapter pattern that provides consistent interfaces for both REST and GraphQL operations.

**Adapter Benefits:**

- Consistent error handling across different API types
- Unified configuration and caching strategies
- Type-safe interfaces with full TypeScript support
- Easy switching between implementation strategies

**Client Implementations:**

Both REST and GraphQL clients provide consistent APIs:

**Common Features:**

- Standardized error handling and response formatting
- Unified configuration options and defaults
- Consistent TypeScript interfaces and type safety
- Shared caching strategies and optimization

**REST Client Example:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/[name]/query/query.ts`
**GraphQL Client Example:** `app/(routes)/(public)/(examples)/pokemons/query/query.ts`
**Configuration Reference:** `app/services/http/core/core.ts`

## State Management Architecture

### State Classification Strategy

The architecture distinguishes between different types of application state:

**Local Component State (React useState/useReducer)**

- Form data and input validation state
- UI component state (modals, dropdowns, toggles)
- Temporary interaction state
- Component-specific derived state

**Global Application State (Zustand)**

- User authentication and session data
- Application-wide preferences and settings
- Persistent user data and configurations
- Cross-component shared state

**Server State (TanStack Query)**

- API response data and caching
- Background synchronization
- Optimistic updates and error recovery
- Request state management (loading, error states)

**Decision Criteria:** Use global state when data needs to persist across route changes or is shared between unrelated components.

## Component Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

The component system is organized in layers of increasing specificity:

**UI Components** (`app/components/ui/`)

- Basic, reusable interface elements
- Design system implementation
- No business logic or external dependencies
- High reusability across different contexts

**Structure Components** (`app/components/structure/`)

- Layout and navigation components
- Application shell and wrapper components
- Shared structural patterns

**View Components** (`app/views/`)

- Complete page implementations
- Business logic coordination
- Component composition and orchestration
- Route-specific functionality

**View-Specific Components** (`app/views/[view]/components/`)

- Components used exclusively within specific views
- Complex view-internal logic and interactions
- Not intended for reuse outside the parent view

**Example Implementations:**

- UI Component: `app/components/ui/spinner/`
- View-Specific: `app/views/pokemon-detail/components/`

## Error Handling Architecture

### Layered Error Management

The architecture implements error handling at multiple levels:

**API Level Error Handling**

- HTTP status code interpretation
- Network timeout and connectivity issues
- Response validation and parsing errors
- Retry logic and circuit breaker patterns

**Application Level Error Recovery**

- User-friendly error messages and fallback UI
- Error boundary implementation for component isolation
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Error reporting and monitoring integration

**Implementation References:**

- HTTP Error Handling: `app/services/http/core/core.ts` - error response processing
- Component Error Boundaries: Route-level error.tsx files
- User Error Display: `app/components/ui/` - error state components

## Caching Strategy

### Multi-Layer Caching

The application implements caching at multiple levels for optimal performance:

1. **Browser Cache:** HTTP headers and service worker
2. **CDN Cache:** Edge location caching for global performance
3. **Next.js Cache:** Server-side rendering and API route caching
4. **Client Cache:** TanStack Query and application state caching

**Configuration References:**

- Next.js Caching: `next.config.js` - cache headers and revalidation
- TanStack Query: `app/services/http/providers/react-query.tsx` - query client configuration
- HTTP Service: `app/services/http/core/core.ts` - cache configuration options

## Testing Architecture

### Testing Strategy Organization

The testing approach aligns with the component architecture:

**Unit Testing Focus**

- Component behavior and user interactions
- Utility function correctness and edge cases
- Business logic isolation and validation

**Integration Testing Scope**

- Component interaction patterns
- Data flow between architectural layers
- API integration and error handling

**Testing Structure Example:** `app/components/ui/spinner/`

### Co-location Principle

Tests are organized alongside implementation files for:

- Easier maintenance and discovery
- Clear association between tests and functionality
- Simplified refactoring and updates

## Development Workflow Integration

### Quality Assurance Automation

The architecture integrates quality checks at multiple points:

**Pre-commit Validation**

- TypeScript compilation with strict configuration
- ESLint validation with custom rules
- Prettier formatting enforcement
- Vitest test execution with coverage requirements

**Continuous Integration Pipeline**

- Automated testing across multiple environments
- Build verification and deployment readiness
- Code quality metrics and reporting
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Design Decisions and Rationale

### Server-Side First Approach

**Decision:** Prioritize server-side rendering and data fetching
**Rationale:** Optimal SEO, faster initial page loads, reduced client-side complexity
**Trade-offs:** More complex client-side interactions, potential server load increase

### Adapter Pattern for HTTP Services

**Decision:** Abstract HTTP implementations behind adapter interfaces
**Rationale:** Flexibility to change implementations, consistent API, easier testing
**Trade-offs:** Additional abstraction layer, initial setup complexity

### Co-located Query Organization

**Decision:** Place data fetching logic adjacent to route components
**Rationale:** Clear data dependencies, easier maintenance, simplified testing
**Trade-offs:** Potential duplication across similar routes, larger route directories

### Layered Component Architecture

**Decision:** Organize components by reusability and specificity
**Rationale:** Clear separation of concerns, easier maintenance, consistent patterns
**Trade-offs:** Additional directory structure, decision overhead for placement

## Future Considerations

### Scalability Implications

The current architecture supports growth through:

- Modular organization enabling team scaling
- Clear boundaries facilitating parallel development
- Consistent patterns reducing onboarding time
- Flexible adapter system accommodating new requirements

### Evolution Pathways

Potential architectural enhancements:

- Micro-frontend integration for large-scale applications
- Advanced caching strategies for global deployment
- Real-time data synchronization for collaborative features
- Progressive Web App capabilities for mobile experience
