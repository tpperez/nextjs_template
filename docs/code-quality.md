## Overview

Code quality follows automated enforcement patterns with comprehensive tooling integration across development workflow and version control processes.

**Quality Enforcement Strategy:**

- VSCode format on save automation ensures immediate code consistency during development
- IDE integration provides real-time quality feedback and error detection
- Pre-commit automation ensures code standards before version control
- Automated linting and formatting maintain consistent code style
- Type checking prevents runtime errors and improves developer experience
- Test execution with coverage tracking ensures code reliability

**Tool Responsibilities:**

- **ESLint**: Code linting and pattern enforcement with TypeScript integration
- **Prettier**: Automated code formatting and style consistency
- **Husky**: Pre-commit hook automation for quality gates
- **lint-staged**: Targeted processing of staged files for efficiency
- **Commitlint**: Conventional commit message standards enforcement
- **Vitest**: Test execution with coverage reporting and thresholds

## Guidelines

### Development Environment Standards

**IDE Integration Principles:**

- Real-time feedback prevents errors from entering version control
- Automatic formatting eliminates style discussions and cognitive overhead
- Consistent tooling across team members through standardized extensions
- Type safety validation provides immediate developer confidence

**Quality at Source Strategy:**

- Problems detected and resolved at point of creation rather than later stages
- Reduced friction through automation minimizes quality as afterthought
- Standardized environment ensures predictable behavior across development team

### Code Standards Enforcement

**Pattern Consistency Approach:**

- Prevents bugs before they reach production through automated pattern detection
- Eliminates runtime type errors and improves developer confidence through TypeScript
- Maintains inclusive user experience through accessibility rule enforcement
- Ensures long-term maintainability through complexity and readability standards

**Automation Philosophy:**

- Tools handle mechanical aspects allowing developers to focus on business logic
- Immediate feedback loops reduce time between error introduction and correction
- Consistent application of standards regardless of individual developer preferences

### Pre-commit Quality Gates

**Version Control Protection:**

- Code quality validation before changes enter shared repository
- Comprehensive verification including type checking, testing, and formatting
- Efficient processing through targeted analysis of only modified files
- Standardized commit messaging for improved project history and automation

**Quality Assurance Process:**

- Multiple validation layers ensure comprehensive coverage without redundancy
- Automated fixes applied where possible to reduce developer interruption
- Clear feedback on quality violations with actionable resolution steps

### Testing and Coverage Standards

**Reliability Assurance:**

- Minimum 80% coverage thresholds ensure adequate testing without excessive overhead
- Fast test execution maintains developer productivity during active development
- Comprehensive reporting provides visibility into code quality trends
- Integration with development workflow prevents quality regression

**Quality Measurement:**

- Coverage metrics track both breadth and depth of testing
- Performance monitoring ensures quality improvements don't impact user experience
- Continuous validation maintains confidence in codebase reliability over time
