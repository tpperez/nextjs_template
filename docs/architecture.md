## Overview

The template uses a **coordinator pattern** with Views as central orchestrators, providing clear separation of concerns while maintaining development productivity. The architecture prioritizes maintainability through established conventions and explicit data flow patterns.

#### Core Architectural Principle

Views act as coordinators that orchestrate data fetching, state management, component composition, and user interactions, while maintaining clear boundaries between server-side and client-side concerns.

---

## Architecture Patterns

### Layered Architecture Model

The application follows a layered architecture with clear separation of responsibilities and explicit data flow patterns:

```

#### Architecture Flow Overview

The coordinator pattern ensures that Views serve as the central orchestration point for all page functionality, while maintaining clear boundaries between different concerns and rendering contexts.

### Route-View Relationship Pattern

#### Core Principle

Every page route has a corresponding view component, with routes handling server-side setup and views coordinating all page functionality.

#### Route Responsibilities

- Server component implementation for initial data fetching
- Metadata generation for SEO optimization
- Static generation configuration when applicable
- Error handling at the route level
- Data validation and error boundaries

#### View Responsibilities

- Complete page implementation and user experience
- Component composition and layout orchestration
- Client-side state management and user interactions
- Integration between server data and client enhancements
- Progressive enhancement without blocking initial render

#### Data Flow Pattern

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Route as Route Component
    participant Query as Query Function
    participant Service as HTTP Service
    participant API as External API
    participant View as View Component
    participant Component as UI Components

    Route->>Query: Direct function call
    Query->>Service: HTTP request via restClient/graphqlClient
    Service->>API: External API call
    API-->>Service: Response data
    Service-->>Query: Formatted response
    Query-->>Route: Structured data
    Route->>View: Pass initial data as props
    View->>Component: Compose UI with data
    Component-->>View: User interactions
    View->>Service: Client-side data requests
```

## Layer Implementation

### Routes Layer - Server-Side Entry Points

#### Core Responsibility

Server components that handle routing, initial data fetching, and server-side rendering optimization.

#### Key Characteristics

- Server component implementation with async data fetching
- Next.js App Router integration with file-based routing
- Metadata generation for SEO and social sharing
- Static generation and ISR configuration
- Route-level error handling and not-found scenarios

#### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Route structure example
const Page = async ({ params }: IPageProps) => {
  const { id } = await params
  const data = await getEntityData(id)

  if (!data.success || !data.data) {
    notFound()
  }

  return <View data={data.data} />
}
```

#### Key Features

- Automatic static generation with [`generateStaticParams`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params)
- Dynamic metadata generation with [`generateMetadata`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-metadata)
- ISR configuration with [`revalidate`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data) directive
- Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- Direct query function integration

---

### Queries Layer - Data Fetching Abstraction

#### Core Responsibility

Co-located data fetching functions that handle API communication, error handling, and response formatting.

#### Architectural Decision

Queries are co-located with routes to maintain proximity between data requirements and route implementation, while providing reusable data fetching patterns.

#### Key Characteristics

- Type-safe API response handling with comprehensive error boundaries
- Integration with `@/services/http` for consistent API patterns
- Response formatting and validation
- Cache configuration and revalidation strategies
- Error handling with structured response objects

#### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Query structure example
const getEntityData = async (id: string) => {
  try {
    const response = await restClient.get<IEntity>(`/entities/${id}`, {
      baseUrl: process.env.API_BASE_URL,
      revalidate: 3600,
    })

    return {
      success: true,
      data: response,
      error: null,
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      data: null,
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error',
    }
  }
}
```

#### Benefits

- Consistent error handling patterns across all data fetching
- Type safety with TypeScript integration
- Reusable data fetching logic
- Integration with [Next.js caching mechanisms](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching)
- Clear separation between data fetching and presentation

---

### Views Layer - Central Orchestrators

#### Core Responsibility

Complete page implementations that orchestrate data, state, components, and user interactions as central coordination points.

#### Architectural Decision

Views serve as the primary coordination layer, integrating server data from routes with client-side enhancements, state management, and component composition.

#### Key Characteristics

- Complete page structure and user experience implementation
- Integration between server data and client-side enhancements
- State management coordination across multiple sources
- Component composition with clear data flow
- User interaction handling and progressive enhancement

#### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// View structure example
const View = ({ data }: IViewProps) => {
  const { addToHistory } = useHistoryStore()

  useEffect(() => {
    const item = {
      id: data.id,
      name: data.name,
      timestamp: Date.now(),
    }
    addToHistory(item)
  }, [data.id, data.name, addToHistory])

  return (
    <div className='min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-50 to-gray-100 py-6'>
      {/* Component composition with server data */}
      <EntityDetails entity={data} />
      <RelatedItems entityId={data.id} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Coordination Capabilities

- **Server Data Integration**: Receives initial data from route as props
- **Client State Management**: Integrates with [Zustand stores](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for persistent state
- **Component Composition**: Orchestrates both global and view-specific components
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Adds client-side features without blocking initial render
- **User Experience**: Handles loading states, error boundaries, and user interactions

---

### Services Layer - Unified API Communication

#### Core Responsibility

Unified HTTP clients and API communication patterns used by both server-side queries and client-side hooks.

#### Architectural Decision

Services provide a unified abstraction layer for API communication, supporting both REST and GraphQL patterns with consistent error handling and type safety.

#### Key Characteristics

- Universal HTTP clients supporting both server and client contexts
- REST and GraphQL adapter implementations
- Consistent error handling and response formatting
- Type-safe request/response patterns
- Cache integration with Next.js and TanStack Query

#### Implementation Overview

```typescript
// Services expose unified clients
export { restClient } from './rest'
export { graphqlClient } from './graphql'
export type { IRestRequestOptions, IGraphQLRequest } from './types'
```

#### Reference Implementation

`@/services/http`

#### Usage Contexts

- **Server-side**: Used by query functions for initial data fetching
- **Client-side**: Used by custom hooks for dynamic data updates
- **Universal**: Same API patterns work in both rendering contexts
- **Flexible**: Teams can choose REST or GraphQL based on data requirements

---

### Stores Layer - Client State Management

#### Core Responsibility

Client-side state management for user preferences, UI state, and cross-session data persistence.

#### State Management Strategy

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "State Types"
        A[Server State] -->|"TanStack Query"| B[API Responses]
        C[Client State] -->|"Zustand Stores"| D[User Preferences]
        C -->|"Zustand Stores"| E[UI State]
        C -->|"Zustand Stores"| F[Cross-Session Data]
    end

    subgraph "Integration Patterns"
        G[Views] -->|"Data Fetching"| A
        G -->|"State Management"| C
        H[Custom Hooks] -->|"Server Data"| A
        H -->|"Client Data"| C
        I[Components] -->|"State Updates"| G
    end

    style A fill:#fce4ec
    style C fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
    style H fill:#f1f8e9
```

#### Implementation Pattern

```typescript
// Store structure example
const useHistoryStore = create<IHistoryStore>()(
  persist(
    (set) => ({
      history: [],
      addToHistory: (item: IHistoryItem) => {
        return set((state) => {
          // State mutation logic with persistence
          const updatedHistory = [item, ...state.history.slice(0, 9)]
          return { history: updatedHistory }
        })
      },
      clearHistory: () => set({ history: [] }),
    }),
    {
      name: 'app-history',
      partialize: (state) => ({ history: state.history }),
    },
  ),
)
```

#### Store Characteristics

- **Feature-based**: Stores organized by feature domains
- **Persistent**: Cross-session data with [local storage integration](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#persist-middleware)
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript integration with interfaces
- **Reactive**: Automatic component updates on state changes

## Data Flow Strategy

### Overview

This section outlines the data flow patterns that enable seamless integration between server-side and client-side operations, ensuring optimal performance and developer experience across all architectural layers.

#### Data Flow Patterns

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Server-Side Flow"
        A[Route Component] -->|"Direct Call"| B[Query Function]
        B -->|"HTTP Request"| C[HTTP Services]
        C -->|"API Response"| D[External APIs]
        B -->|"Formatted Data"| E[View Component]
    end

    subgraph "Client-Side Flow"
        E -->|"Custom Hooks"| F[TanStack Query]
        F -->|"HTTP Request"| C
        F -->|"Cached Data"| G[Client Cache]
        G -->|"Reactive Updates"| E
    end

    subgraph "State Integration"
        E -->|"Persistent State"| H[Zustand Stores]
        H -->|"Cross-Session Data"| I[Local Storage]
        H -->|"State Updates"| E
    end

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#f3e5f5
    style C fill:#fff3e0
    style E fill:#e8f5e8
    style F fill:#fce4ec
    style G fill:#f1f8e9
    style H fill:#e1f5fe
    style I fill:#f1f8e9
```

#### Integration Benefits

- **Unified API Patterns**: Same HTTP services work for both server and client
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized error patterns across all data fetching
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration throughout the data flow
- **Performance Optimization**: Appropriate caching strategies for each context
- **Developer Experience**: Consistent patterns reduce cognitive load

### Implementation Strategy

#### Server-Side Data Pattern

- Routes call query functions directly for initial data fetching
- Query functions use `@/services/http` with [Next.js caching integration](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching)
- Data passed to views as props for immediate rendering
- ISR configuration for optimal performance and SEO

#### Client-Side Enhancement Pattern

- Views use custom hooks for dynamic data requirements
- Custom hooks integrate [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for reactive caching
- Same `@/services/http` provide consistent API patterns
- Progressive enhancement without blocking initial render

#### Hybrid Implementation Example

A typical detail page demonstrates this pattern:

1. **Server-side**: Route fetches initial entity data via REST service
2. **Client-side**: View enhances with related data via GraphQL service
3. **State management**: Zustand store handles viewing history persistence
4. **User experience**: Fast initial render with progressive feature enhancement

## Component Organization

### Architectural Component Hierarchy

#### System-Level Component Strategy

Components are organized by architectural scope and responsibility within the overall system design, promoting reusability and maintaining clear boundaries between different system layers.

#### Component Architecture Levels

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "System Architecture"
        A[Application Layer] -->|"Global Infrastructure"| B[Global Components]
        A -->|"Feature Implementation"| C[View-Specific Components]
    end

    subgraph "Component Scope"
        B -->|"Cross-Feature Usage"| D[UI Design System]
        B -->|"Application Structure"| E[Layout Components]
        C -->|"Feature Logic"| F[Domain Components]
        C -->|"View Coordination"| G[Orchestrator Components]
    end

    subgraph "Architectural Boundaries"
        H[Views] -->|"Compose"| B
        H -->|"Coordinate"| C
        I[Routes] -->|"Initialize"| H
        J[Services] -->|"Support"| H
    end

    style A fill:#e1f5fe
    style B fill:#fff3e0
    style C fill:#e8f5e8
    style H fill:#e8f5e8
    style I fill:#f3e5f5
    style J fill:#fce4ec
```

#### Architectural Scope Boundaries

- **Global Infrastructure**: Components serving application-wide architectural needs
- **Feature Domain**: Components encapsulating specific business domain logic
- **View Orchestration**: Components coordinating between different architectural layers
- **System Integration**: Components bridging external systems and internal architecture

#### Architectural Benefits

- **Layer Separation**: Clear boundaries between different system responsibilities
- **Scalability**: Components can evolve independently within their architectural scope
- **Maintainability**: Architectural patterns provide predictable structure for teams
- **Reusability**: Components designed with architectural scope in mind promote appropriate reuse

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architectural Implementation Patterns

#### Coordinator Pattern Implementation

The architecture enforces a clear coordinator pattern where Views serve as orchestration points between different system layers:

```typescript
// Architectural pattern example
const View = ({ data }: IViewProps) => {
  // Layer Integration: State management
  const { addToHistory } = useHistoryStore()

  // Layer Integration: Client-side enhancement
  const { data: enhancedData } = useEnhancedData()

  // Layer Integration: Component orchestration
  return (
    <div>
      <ServerDataComponent data={data} />
      <ClientDataComponent enhanced={enhancedData} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### Architectural Coordination Principles

- **Single Coordination Point**: Views coordinate all page-level system interactions
- **Layer Integration**: Views bridge server-side and client-side architectural layers
- **State Orchestration**: Views manage integration between different state management systems
- **Progressive Architecture**: Views enable progressive enhancement without architectural complexity

### System Layer Integration

#### Multi-Layer Data Architecture

The system integrates multiple architectural layers seamlessly through established patterns:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Route as Route Layer
    participant Query as Query Layer
    participant Service as Service Layer
    participant View as View Layer
    participant Store as Store Layer

    Route->>Query: Server-side data request
    Query->>Service: HTTP service call
    Service-->>Query: Formatted response
    Query-->>Route: Structured data
    Route->>View: Initial data coordination
    View->>Store: Client state integration
    View->>Service: Client enhancement requests
    Service-->>View: Enhanced data
```

#### Integration Guidelines

- **Server-Client Bridge**: Views serve as architectural bridge between server and client layers
- **Service Abstraction**: Unified `@/services/http` provides consistent API patterns across contexts
- **State Coordination**: Views orchestrate between server state ([TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)) and client state ([Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/))
- **Progressive Layers**: Each layer can enhance functionality without breaking architectural boundaries

### Architectural Decision Framework

#### Technology Selection Within Architecture

The architecture provides flexibility for teams to make technology choices within established patterns:

##### Service Layer Decisions

- **REST or GraphQL**: Both adapters work within the same architectural patterns using `@/services/http`
- **Caching Strategy**: [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) for client, [Next.js ISR](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating) for server
- **State Management**: [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) for client state, service layer for server state

##### Component Architecture Decisions

- **Global vs Domain**: Components classified by architectural scope, not just reusability
- **Orchestration Level**: Views determine component coordination patterns
- **Enhancement Strategy**: Progressive enhancement through architectural layers

##### Implementation Flexibility

- **Framework Agnostic**: Architectural patterns independent of specific implementations
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams choose specific technologies within architectural boundaries
- **Evolution Path**: Architecture supports incremental adoption and changes
