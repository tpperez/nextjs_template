# Architectural Principles

## Clear Separation of Concerns

directory structure enforces architectural boundaries:

- components handle ui rendering and user interaction
- services manage external api communication
- stores maintain application state
- views coordinate page-level functionality
- utils provide pure helper functions

## Dependency Flow

architecture encourages unidirectional data flow:

- views depend on components, services, and stores
- components depend on utilities and types
- services provide data to stores and views
- utilities remain dependency-free for maximum reusability

## Scalability Considerations

### feature-based organization

structure supports growth through feature modules:

- new features add directories under views/
- feature-specific components stay localized
- shared components promote reusability
- service layer scales with additional apis

### maintenance efficiency

organization optimizes for developer productivity:

- related files stay physically close
- consistent patterns reduce cognitive load
- clear boundaries prevent coupling issues
- modular structure supports team collaboration
